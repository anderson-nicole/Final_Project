# Visual Analytics Final Project
### This repo contains the code for a deployed Streamlit Application. 
## Introduction
This StreamLit application offers an easy to use way of reviewing a hospitals results of the HCAHPS survey to aid in consumer assessment of where they may recieve care from if able to choose such as needing to stay at a hospital for surgical cases. 
## Data: (link)[https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/dgck-syfz#data-table]
The data comes from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and is the results from the October 2024 Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) surveys. The survey is used to get the patients thoughts on their recent US inpatient hospital stay to assess quality-of-care. The full dataset contains multiple releases withing a year for multiple years. 
## Future Work:
- As previously mentioned, there are multiple releases within a year but also archived data of survey results over multiple years. I would like to integrate more data so users can see a hospitals trend over the years to get a better view of a hospitals rating to see if it is in an upward or downward trend.
- Would like to further implements state analysis to view hospital locations within a state, and then search for hospitals that way and overall get a look at how a state is overall doing when it comes to their hospitals for those who may have be a stakeholder in assessing hospitals or implementing policies relative to them.
